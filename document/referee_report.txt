We stand by the version equation that we had that includes the probability of
grazing transits and we have added a paragraph to Section 5 that discusses the
argument. In short, since we injected grazing transits (Table 4) and included
the impact parameter cut in the injection procedure, Q_det already takes this
effect into account. Therefore, if we used (R_s - R_p), we would be
double-counting the impact parameter completeness. This method is preferable
to only injecting full transits and accounting for the impact parameter in the
geometric term because the cut in the search procedure is made on the
_measured/maximum-likelihood_ impact parameter which is generally quite
different from the _true_ impact parameter.

Out of interest, we computed how the result would change if we used the
non-grazing Q_geom and find that the integrated occurrence rate becomes
2.19\pm0.78 instead of 2.00\pm0.72. We don't include this analysis in the
paper (because we don't think that it is correct!) but thought that it might
be of interest to the referee.

We acknowledge this point, but note that this will be at most a minor
correction, considering the selection effects required in the mock-observation
simulations (fewer than three eclipses, and showing only a primary or secondary
eclipse, but not both).  As properly accounting for this effect would move the
planet FPPs only lower, we judge that it is not necessary to treat in detail.
We have added a paragraph discussing this to the end of section 7.

> 3. In Section 7 (pg 24, 2nd to last paragraph), it is mentioned "We list the

The text has been corrected.

This comparison and reference have been added.
